### Problem Statement
Doing a monthly budger with pen and paper can be great for learning how to budget, but it is very easy to makes mistakes and it can take a very long time.  An excel spreadsheet is a nice step up, but if a user isn't familiar with how to use formulas then it can be frustrating to use.  The spreadsheet also needs to be saved on a local computer or network drive.  Making it hard to update and view your budget away from home.

A web-based solution (SommerBudget) would solve the problems of not having to use pen and paper or using a spreadsheet.  All formulas would be done behind the scenes not viewable to the user and it would be accessable anywhere you can connect to the internet allowing you to view and update on the go.
